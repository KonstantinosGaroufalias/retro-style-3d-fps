# Retro Style 3D FPS - Godot Engine

A fast-paced, old-school first-person shooter built with the Godot Game Engine, inspired by classic 90s FPS games. This project demonstrates core FPS mechanics including multiple weapons, enemy AI, particle effects, and retro-style gameplay.

## 🎮 Features

### **Gameplay**
- **Fast-paced old school FPS movement** with smooth character controller
- **Four unique weapons** with distinct mechanics:
  - Machete (melee combat)
  - Shotgun (close-range spread)
  - Machine Gun (rapid fire)
  - Rocket Launcher (explosive projectiles)

### **Enemy AI**
- **Two enemy types**: melee and ranged attackers
- **Pathfinding system** using Godot's navigation mesh
- **Basic artificial intelligence** with different behavioral states

### **Visual Effects**
- **Particle systems** for explosions and smoke trails
- **Weapon animations** and muzzle flashes
- **Retro-style lighting** and environment design
- **Blood effects** and visual feedback systems

### **Game Systems**
- **Health management** system for player and enemies
